# Machine-Learning-Project
Fake Currency Detection using Logistic Regression Algorithm

## About:
Fake Currency Detection is a real problem for both individuals and businesses. Some are constantly finding new methods and techniques to produce counterfeit banknotes, which are essentially indistinguishable from real money. Atleast for human eyes.
### So by using Machine Learning Algorithm we can find this out.

## Dataset:
data_banknote_authentication.txt

## Algorithm Used: 
### Logistic Regression

## Library & Packages used:

• Pandas

• NumPy

• seaborn

• sklearn

• matplotlib

## Steps involved in the Project:
1. Reading dataset and assigning column names.
2. Data exploration - checking for missing values.
3. Checking the behaviour of data using pairplot.
4. Data processing - balancing the imbalanced data using imblearn.
5. Split the data to train and test the model.
6. Creating a ml model and trained it.
7. Model validation using Confusion Matrix.
8. Finally Prediction
